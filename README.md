Final Project for Samsung Convergence Software Academy (Team Portrait)

## Project Description
It's the final project for Samsung Convergence Software Academy. Team Portratit developed the Photo management web service with android application using Spring framework, Java, and Android.

## Portrait
This web service's purpose is the management of personal photos using Picasa(old version of Google Photo). Spreading digital cameras and smartphones, people have a lot of photos. However, these photos don't arrange, but just stored personal devices(PC or smartphone). People don't have enough time to effort arrangement and tagging photos. The team portrait found out the pain points in this situation.

People usually store photos in hardware with the directory structure. However, the hardware in which stored photos are broken easily. Moreover, the directory structure is unfit to find a specific photo. The team portrait tries to overcome these pain points using Google API and tagging system.

Picasa, one of the Google services, provide infinite storage for people with limitation of photo's size. As using Picasa service, Portrait service secures the storage for user's photos. Furthermore, uploading photos with EXIF information and tags. EXIF information already has a date, location information. It makes the portrait can sort photos chronological order and filter by location. User-defined tags are more useful to group the photo into a specific theme.

Portrait service tries to provide added values. One of the added values is the Auto-generated album function. Portrait service groups photos by various levels of date and location. Users can generate a timeline comprising user-generated photo groups by chronological order. All albums can share with other users.
