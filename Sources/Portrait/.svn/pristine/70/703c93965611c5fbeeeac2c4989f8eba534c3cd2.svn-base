			<p>We may define a food to be any substance which will repair the
				functional waste of the body, increase its growth, or maintain the
				heat, muscular, and nervous energy.</p>
			<p>In its most comprehensive sense, the oxygen of the air is a
				food; as although it is admitted by the lungs, it passes into the
				blood, and there re-acts upon the other food which has passed
				through the stomach. It is usual, however, to restrict the term food
				to such nutriment as enters the body by the intestinal canal. Water
				is often spoken of as being distinct from food, but for this there
				is no sufficient reason.</p>

			<h3>Flesh-formers, heat-givers, and bone-formers</h3>
			<p>Mineral matter is quite as necessary for plant as for animal
				life, and is therefore present in all food, except in the case of
				some highly-prepared ones, such as sugar, starch and oil. Children
				require a good proportion of calcium phosphate for the growth of
				their bones, whilst adults require less. The outer part of the grain
				of cereals is the richest in mineral constituents, white flour and
				rice are deficient. Wheatmeal and oatmeal are especially recommended
				for the quantity of phosphates and other salts contained in them.
				Mineral matter is necessary not only for the bones but for every
				tissue of the body.</p>

			<h3>Soaking in cold water</h3>
			<p>The loss on soaking in cold water, unless the water is
				preserved, is seen to be considerable. The split lentils, having had
				the protecting skin removed, lose most. In every case the ash
				contained a good deal of phosphate and lime. Potatoes are rich in
				important potash salts; by boiling a large quantity is lost, by
				steaming less and by baking in the skins, scarcely any. The flavour
				is also much better after baking.</p>
			
			<p>Organic Compounds are formed by living organisms (a few can
				also be produced by chemical means). They are entirely decomposed by
				combustion.</p>
			<h3>Carbon compounds or heat-producers</h3>
			<p>The Non-Nitrogenous Organic Compounds are commonly called
				carbon compounds or heat-producers, but these terms are also
				descriptive of the nitrogenous compounds. These contain carbon,
				hydrogen and oxygen only, and furnish by their oxidation or
				combustion in the body the necessary heat, muscular and nervous
				energy. The final product of their combustion is water and carbon
				dioxide (carbonic acid gas).</p>
			
			<h3>From acid and rancidity</h3>
			<p>The most esteemed and dearest oil is Almond. What is called
				Peach-kernel oil (Oleum Amygdalæ Persicæ), but which in commerce
				includes the oil obtained from plum and apricot stones, is almost as
				tasteless and useful, whilst it is considerably cheaper. </p>
			<p>The solid fats sold as butter and lard substitutes, consist of
				deodorised cocoanut oil, and they are excellent for cooking
				purposes. It is claimed that biscuits, &amp;c., made from them may
				be kept for a much longer period, without showing any trace of
				rancidity, than if butter or lard had been used. They are also to be
				had agreeably flavoured by admixture with almond, walnut, &amp;c.,
				"cream."</p>

			<p>Vegetable Acids are composed of the same three elements and
				undergo combustion into the same compounds as the carbohydrates.
				They rouse the appetite, stimulate digestion, and finally form
				carbonates in combination with the alkalies, thus increasing the
				alkalinity of the blood. The chief vegetable acids are: malic acid,
				in the apple, pear, cherry, &amp;c.; citric acid, in the lemon,
				lime, orange, gooseberry, cranberry, strawberry, raspberry, &amp;c.;
				tartaric acid, in the grape, pineapple, &amp;c.</p>

			<p>Some place these under Class III. or food adjuncts. Oxalic
				acid (except when in the insoluble state of calcium oxalate), and
				several other acids are poisonous.</p>

			<h3>The essential part of every living cell</h3>
			<p>Proteids or Albuminoids are frequently termed flesh-formers.
				They are composed of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and a small
				quantity of sulphur, and are extremely complex bodies. </p>

			<p>Proteids are excreted from the body as water, carbon dioxide,
				urea, uric acid, sulphates, &amp;c.</p>

			The principal proteids of animal origin have their corresponding
			proteids in the vegetable kingdom. Some kinds, whether of animal or
			vegetable origin, are more easily digested than others. They have the
			same physiological value from whichever kingdom they are derived.
			</p>

			<p>The Osseids comprise ossein, gelatin, cartilage, &amp;c., from
				bone, skin, and connective issue. </p>

			<p>The Vegetable Kingdom is the prime source of all organic food;
				water, and to a slight extent salts, form the only food that animals
				can derive directly from the inorganic kingdom. When man consumes
				animal food—a sheep for example—he is only consuming a portion of
				the food which that sheep obtained from grass, clover, turnips,
				&amp;c. All the proteids of the flesh once existed as proteids in
				the vegetables; some in exactly the same chemical form.</p>

			<blockquote>A comparatively small quantity of proteid
				matter, such as is easily obtained from vegetable food, is ample for
				the general needs of the body.</blockquote>
			<p>Flesh contains no starch or sugar, but a small quantity of
				glycogen. The fat in an animal is derived from the carbohydrates,
				the fats and the proteids of the vegetables consumed. </p>
